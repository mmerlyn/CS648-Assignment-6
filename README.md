# CS648-Assignment-6

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 6**, which focuses on **JavaScript conditional logic and looping problems**. Each problem is implemented in a separate JavaScript file, located in the `javascript/` folder.

---

## Assignment Problems

### 1. Larger or Smaller?

An application that accepts **two integers** via prompts and displays the **larger number**. Handles the case where both numbers are equal.

### 2. The “Coin Flip” Game

A game that:

1. Generates a random coin flip.
2. Prompts the user for **Heads or Tails**.
3. Compares the result with the user’s choice.
4. Displays win/lose messages via `alert()`.

### 3. The “Coin Flip” Game Redux

A variation using a **for loop**:

1. Declares a coin flip variable.
2. Loops **10 times**, generating a random coin flip each iteration.
3. Logs `Heads` or `Tails` to the console based on the result.

### 4. The “Coin Flip Streak” Game

A do-while loop game that:

1. Flips a coin repeatedly until `Tails` occurs.
2. Logs each flip to the console.
3. Allows the user to see how long a streak of `Heads` lasts.

### 5. Looping a Triangle

Generates a triangle pattern in the console:

### 7. Marco! Polo!

Iterates numbers from 1 to 100:

- Multiples of 3 → `"Marco!"`
- Multiples of 5 → `"Polo!"`
- Multiples of both 3 and 5 → `"Marco! Polo!"`

### 8. Countdown

Prompts the user for a number and counts **down to 0**, logging each number to the console.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Uncomment the script you want to run.
3. Open the **console** (`F12`) to see results for scripts that use `console.log()`.
4. Interact with `prompt()` and `alert()` popups as needed.
